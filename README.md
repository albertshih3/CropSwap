## Inspiration
We started off by identifying potential problems that local farmers could face that AgTech could help solve. What we found is that those just starting out had a hard time getting a grasp on the basic "science" of farming. We also found that connections between local farms and businesses was high on the priority list. This led us to develop CropSwap! Our goal is to create a guide that helps new farmers plan out potential crops as well as create new connections with their local community.

## What does CropSwap do?
CropSwap provides crop rotation guidance based on county-specific data, aiding farmers in optimizing their yields. This removes the need to do extensive research on what to plant and when to plant it. Additionally, it facilitates a seed exchange among farmers, ensuring that it is possible to access seeds without needing to spend a lot of money. Moreover, it acts as a platform connecting farmers with potential clients and fellow agriculturists.

## How was it built?
We developed CropSwap using React for the frontend and MongoDB for data storage. Authentication is managed through Auth0. We wanted to take time to learn new technologies which is why we chose the software suite that we did!

## Challenges!
One major challenge we had was learning how to use MongoDB as well as Auth0 and how to seamlessly connect it to our React front end. We wanted to take some time to learn new technologies, so we went into this challenge not knowing anything about MongoDB and Auth0. I am glad to say that after a lot of research (and one too many youtube guides), we were able to integrate all three platforms together and we learned a lot about the underlying technology along the way!

## Project Acomplishments
Learning MongoDB + Auth0! As we said above these were the hardest things for us as we came into this hackathon with no experience with these services. Being able to use them to create a fully functional web app is something that we are extremely proud of!

## What We Learned
- Using MongoDB databases, collections, and documents
- Auth0 implementation, including custom login screens, access management, and JS integration
- Creating and hosting a serverless function to run as our backend to query MongoDB data.
